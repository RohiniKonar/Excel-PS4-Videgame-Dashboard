Analysis of the PS4 Videogame Sales

We all know about videogames and also the fact that this is not limited to kids. As a stress buster a lot of people play video games and a lot of companies as well have a game room setup for their employeed so that they canplay and relax. So, here we have this dataset that was provided to me as part of a assignment that I was doing in my masters. I used this dataset to get some insights about the sales of PS4 videogame globally and across 3 regions namely North America, Japan and Europe.

This is a very basic version of a dashboard which was created using excel and pivot tables. Not to forget Pivot tables are one of the powerful tools in excel!

Key Insights found are:
- Europe is the region with the highest sales for PS4 games, followed by North America.
- The highest sold game worldwide is Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. This game is also in the top 5 in each region. Another game following the same pattern is Grand Theft Auto.
- FIFA seems to be highly popular across all Europe as all 3 releases of FIFA during this period (2015, 2016, 2017) are in the top 5. FIFA is not in the top 5 for neither Japan or North America which shows Europe's preference for football games.
- Most sales are generated from the publisher Electronic Arts.


A quick preview of the Dashboard.
